Hello I have developed this called **E-Commerce-Backend-WebServices-Restful-APIs** using **Spring Boot, Spring JPA, Spring Security, MySQL.**

This Spring Boot project is a E-Commerce Backend Webservices designed for functionalities of E-Commerce. It features endpoints for adding, updating, listing, and deleting orders, products, order-items, reviews, users and cart-items. The application supports authentication for Admin/Users, ensuring secure access to each functionality of respective roles.

I have used entities Orders, Order-Item, Products, Cart-Items, Users and Reviews. Since ORDER is a reserved keyword in MySQL we canâ€™t use it so we use ORDERS.


`STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT:`
1. Download the zip file and extract the file. Open in either VS Code or Eclipse or IntelliJ.
2. navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

    2.1 Create a Database on your wish (`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:PORT_NUMBER/DBname`)
   
    2.2 Change username and password (`spring.datasource.username= USERNAME`), (`spring.datasource.password= PASSWORD`)

    2.3 Check out the PlayerDetails file in root folder. You can use that to upload in database for Player and Ranks table.

4. Open terminal and enter this command (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`)
